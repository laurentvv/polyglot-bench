A comprehensive performance benchmarking tool that compares execution performance across Python, Rust, Go, and TypeScript implementations.

## üöÄ Overview

The Multi-Language Performance Benchmark Tool is designed to provide accurate and meaningful performance comparisons across different programming languages. It implements standardized computational benchmarks that measure execution time, memory usage, and CPU efficiency for equivalent algorithms across four major programming languages.

### Performance Insights

Based on extensive benchmarking with the latest performance scoring algorithm (90% weight on execution time), **Rust consistently outperforms other languages in computational tasks** with a performance score of 96.46, significantly higher than TypeScript (70.36), Python (61.15), and Go (46.54). **Go performance varies significantly** across benchmark categories, showing acceptable results in I/O operations but lagging considerably in CPU-intensive computations where it can be 2-3x slower than Python and Rust. **Python excels in I/O-bound operations** and offers competitive performance in network-related benchmarks while maintaining excellent memory efficiency. **TypeScript shows strong performance in specific benchmarks**, particularly in I/O operations like GZIP compression and JSON parsing.

**Key Performance Characteristics**:
- **Rust**: Superior computational performance, excellent memory efficiency, fastest in algorithmic benchmarks
- **TypeScript**: Strong I/O performance, good balance between speed and memory usage

## üìà Performance Scoring System

The tool uses a sophisticated performance scoring algorithm that combines multiple metrics to provide a comprehensive evaluation of language performance. The scoring system applies the following weights:

- **Execution Time (90%)**: The dominant factor in performance scoring. Lower execution times result in higher scores.
- **Memory Usage (5%)**: Memory efficiency contributes to the overall score with lower memory usage being better.
- **Reliability (5%)**: Based on success rate and consistency of execution times.

### Performance Score Calculation

The performance score is calculated using the formula:
```
Performance Score = (Time Score √ó 0.9) + (Memory Score √ó 0.05) + (Reliability Score √ó 0.05)
```

Where:
- **Time Score** = 10000 / (Average Execution Time in ms)
- **Memory Score** = 100 / (Average Memory Usage in MB)
- **Reliability Score** = (Success Rate √ó 0.8) + (Consistency Score √ó 0.2)
- **Consistency Score** = 1 / (1 + Standard Deviation of Execution Times)

This scoring system heavily emphasizes execution speed while still considering memory efficiency and reliability. Higher performance scores indicate better overall performance.
